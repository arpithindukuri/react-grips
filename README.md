## What is it?

react-grips is an easy, hook-based, platform agnostic way of making components draggable, and droppable.

In functionality, it is (will be... eventually) similar to [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) (in terms of look and feel) and [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd/) (in terms of functionality)
